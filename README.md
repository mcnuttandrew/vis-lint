# Vis Linter for matplotlib

POC for a vis linter. Implementation still in progress, trys out a variety of lint rules against meek's initial lint rule list.

uses virtualenv, to start run source bin/activate, then run pytest against the test files.


The notebooks in example_nb/ are used to create the visualization found in the paper.
